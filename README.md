Little utilities for various birding/nature stats. 

* Seasonality builds a csv of how many years a species was seen in a specified time period (month, half month, etc). 

* MCCC builder generates Acorn scripts to update maps for county/state/country

* ebirdmonthlytotals calculates stats (how many species have been seen each month by all ebirders, which ones I'm missing for each month/half month)
